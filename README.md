## Tech radar overview

This folder contains our tech index - a comprehensive collection of technologies, tools, platforms, languages, frameworks, and techniques that we are actively using or evaluating. Each technology is categorized and assessed according to our adoption stages.

For a detailed explanation of how our tech radar works, please refer to the [Tech Radar handbook page](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook/blob/master/community/radar.md).

## Part of our second brain

The tech radar is an important component of our [knowledge base](https://github.com/dwarvesf/handbook/blob/master/knowledge-base.md) - our team's shared second brain. By documenting and categorizing technologies we use or evaluate, we create a valuable resource that helps us:

- Make informed technology decisions
- Avoid duplicating research efforts
- Share technical insights across teams
- Track our technology evolution over time

## Making decisions

Following our 3x2 framework, technology decisions consider:

- People x Customer x Number
- Now x Then

Being able to make decisions on technology adoption trains us to accept responsibility with an open mind. We encourage team members to participate in the evaluation process and contribute their expertise and experiences.
