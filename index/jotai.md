### Description

Jotai takes an atomic approach to global React state management with a model inspired by Recoil.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

Build state by combining atoms and renders are automatically optimized based on atom dependency. This solves the extra re-render issue of React context and eliminates the need for memoization.

It scales from a simple useState replacement to an enterprise TypeScript application with complex requirements. Plus there are plenty of utilities and integrations to help you along the way!

### What can we do with it

Replace Context or other state management libraries like Redux.

### How should we adopt it

Jotai is a state management library for React. If you want to learn Jotai, you can follow these steps:
