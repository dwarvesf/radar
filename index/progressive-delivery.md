### Description

Progressive delivery is an advanced software delivery approach that allows teams to release new features gradually and safely. It's a step beyond continuous delivery and uses techniques such as canary releases, feature flags, and A/B testing to reduce the risk of introducing bugs or causing downtime. With progressive delivery, teams can test features in production with a small subset of users before rolling them out to the entire user base.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

One of the major advantages of progressive delivery is the ability to roll out new features gradually and safely. This allows teams to catch any bugs or issues early on and fix them before they affect a larger portion of users. Additionally, progressive delivery allows for more targeted testing with specific user groups, making it easier to gather feedback and make improvements.

### What can we do with it

Teams can use progressive delivery to release new features in a controlled and measured way, reducing the risk of downtime or disruptions to the user experience.

### How should we adopt it
