### Description

ViteJS is a build tool and development server that is designed to provide fast and efficient development workflows for modern web applications. It uses a unique approach to building and bundling applications, called "build on demand", that allows developers to build and test their applications quickly and efficiently.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

One of the key benefits of ViteJS is its "build on demand" approach to building and bundling applications. Unlike traditional build tools, which can be slow and cumbersome to work with, ViteJS is designed to be fast and efficient, with incremental build times that allow developers to build and test their applications quickly.

Additionally, ViteJS provides a range of powerful features and integrations, including support for Vue, React, and other popular front-end frameworks. This makes it a great choice for building modern web applications, especially those that require fast and responsive user interfaces.

### What can we do with it

ViteJS can be used to develop a wide range of modern web applications, including single-page applications, progressive web apps, and static websites. It supports a wide range of modern web technologies, including JavaScript modules, Vue.js, React, and TypeScript, and is designed to be highly extensible and configurable.

### How should we adopt it
