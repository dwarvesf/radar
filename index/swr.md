### Description

SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) is a client-side caching library that can be used with popular front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js. It aims to simplify data fetching and caching by providing a standard API for handling asynchronous data and automatically managing cache invalidation.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

SWR has a number of advantages over traditional data fetching approaches. One of the key benefits of SWR is that it allows you to fetch data dynamically and only when needed, reducing unnecessary network requests and improving performance.

Additionally, SWR provides a number of advanced features, such as caching, deduplication, and polling. These features can help reduce server load and improve the user experience by ensuring that data stays up-to-date and minimizing the time it takes for data to be displayed.

### What can we do with it

SWR can be used to manage remote data fetching in a wide variety of applications. It can be used with REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and other remote data sources. Additionally, SWR provides a number of useful features for working with remote data, including automatic revalidation and focus tracking.

SWR is particularly useful in modern web applications that require real-time updates or frequently-changing data.

### How we adopted it
