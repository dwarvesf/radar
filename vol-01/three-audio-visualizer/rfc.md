## Objective

The ultimate goal of my tech radar project here is to learn & create a basic Audio Visualizer with `three.js`, WebAudio API and `react` (using `react-three-fiber`).

Due to the limited of my knowledge, I don't see this as a guide of any sort, but instead a markdown of what I have learned and been able to put into practice. Either way, I will try to make the basic theories clear in my own understanding. For anyone that's interested, I hope this can serve as an inspriring gateway into the world of `three,js`.

Things I'll go through:

- Basic `three,js` concepts
- Basic WebAudio API concepts used in the project
- An (ELI5) presentation of how audio is processed and visualized through `three,js` and WebAudio API

## Motivation

- `three,js` has been my interest since university but I've never given the effort to learn it seriously. This project is my first step to re-learn it and develop my knowledge in `three,js` professionally.
- Audio visualizing is a strange and appealing domain to me. I figured it would be interesting to try implementing it for a first `three,js` project.
- Using `react-three-fiber` is a risky choice. Still, I want to try writing `three,js` in a _React_ way.

## Benefit

- A sample project which covers multiple basic `three,js` & audio processing concepts that I can refer to when necessary
- A small presentation of what `three,js` has to offer if anyone's interested
