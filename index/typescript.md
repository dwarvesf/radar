### Description

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and other features to the language. It is rapidly gaining popularity among developers, particularly those working on large, complex projects.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

One of the key advantages of TypeScript is its ability to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This can significantly reduce the number of bugs and errors in a codebase, particularly in large, complex projects. Additionally, TypeScript provides better support for tooling and editor integration, making it easier for developers to work with their code and catch errors before they become problems.

Another advantage of TypeScript is its ability to improve code maintainability and readability. By enforcing strict types and interfaces, TypeScript makes it easier to understand how different parts of a codebase fit together and reduces the risk of unintended side effects or bugs.

### What can we do with it

TypeScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. On the front-end, TypeScript is commonly used with popular frameworks like React and Angular to improve code quality and maintainability. On the back-end, TypeScript can be used with Node.js to improve server-side code quality and to enable better communication between front-end and back-end codebases.
