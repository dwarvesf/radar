### Description

Blue-green deployment is a technique for releasing software updates with zero downtime and minimal risk. It involves deploying a new version of your application (the "green" version) alongside the existing version (the "blue" version), and then gradually routing traffic from the blue version to the green version. This allows you to test and validate the new version before switching over completely, ensuring that your users don't experience any downtime or issues during the deployment process.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method

One of the key benefits of blue-green deployment is that it enables zero-downtime deployments. By having two identical environments, with only one live at a time, you can deploy new versions of your application without any downtime or disruption to users. This can help improve user experience and reduce the risk of downtime-related issues.

Blue Green Deployment enables faster and more frequent releases, as developers can release updates with confidence, knowing that any issues will be caught and resolved quickly.

### What can we do with it

Blue-green deployment can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple web applications to complex microservices architectures. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require high availability and zero-downtime deployments, such as e-commerce websites, financial systems, and other mission-critical applications.

### How should we adopt it

1. Determine which project(s) would benefit from the implementation of blue-green deployment. Consider projects where downtime is critical to success or those where you want to improve release quality.
1. Ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place. This includes setting up a Kubernetes cluster and selecting a continuous development tool such as ArgoCD.
1. Develop a blue-green deployment pipeline that automates the deployment process. This pipeline should include steps for building, testing, and deploying the application to both the blue and green environments.
1. Verify that you can test both the blue and green environments and are able to switch traffic to the green environment once you have confirmed everything is functioning as intended. It is equally important to ensure that the rollback function works properly in case issues arise.
1. Continuously monitor and improve your deployment process to ensure that it is efficient and effective over time. Regularly review and adjust your processes as needed to optimize the benefits of blue-green deployment.
