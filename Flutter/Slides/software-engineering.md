# Flutter comparison with jetpack compose

|Flutter|Jetpack Compose|
|:---|:---|
|Flutter is ready to being use in production apps|Jetpack Compose in the same time is working on by google and far from being usable in production apps|
|Cost more code line to create widget|Cost less code line to create composable because the power of kotlin DSLs|
|Hot Reload is better than "Instant Run" on android studio|@Preview is an amazing feature, it can help you see the design before you need to build the app|
