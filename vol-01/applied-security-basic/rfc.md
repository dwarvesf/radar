## Objective
These works introduce the security patterns of Blockchain, SSH and SSL. The main goal is to briefly explain the underlying security basis of Blockchain, SSH and SSL; therefore providing basic knowledge about security in action.

## Motivation
Security is essential, from the dawn of computers and networks until now. However, as the industry expands, security is embeded and supported in frameworks and low-level layers of the tech-stacks. As a consequence, many developers now are messing around the top-level level layers of the tech-stack, confident that the security issues are solved by frameworks and libraries, and place security in a black box.

Many security failures are due to the lack of knowledge about how the security mechanisms works. Even not many developers know how the most widely-used security technologies works under-the-hood.

Also, raising awareness in security fields for developers is nothing new. There are a plethora of 'security 101' all over the Internet. This works just summaries the basis of Blockchain, SSH ans SSL. If you are interested in security, poking around `capture the flag (CTF)` is a good start.

## Benefit
Hopefully, this works may briefly explain the concepts of security and drag people to have a look at the under-the-hood securities of technologies.
