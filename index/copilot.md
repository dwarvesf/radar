### Description

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI. It is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

Codepilot can significantly improve developer productivity by providing intelligent suggestions and recommendations based on the code being written. This can include suggestions for code snippets, functions, and libraries, as well as recommendations for best practices and coding conventions.

Codepilot also helps developers save time by reducing the need for manual research and documentation. It can provide context-sensitive help and documentation, allowing developers to quickly understand unfamiliar code and make informed decisions about how to proceed.

### What can we do with it

Codepilot can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple code search and discovery to more complex development tasks, such as refactoring, code reviews, and debugging. Its intelligent search and filtering features make it easy for developers to quickly find the code they need, while its integration with popular tools and platforms makes it easy to incorporate into existing workflows.

### How should we adopt it

TBD
