### Description

WebDriverIO is a popular open-source automation testing framework that uses the WebDriver protocol to automate web-based applications. It provides an easy-to-use API and supports multiple programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java. It integrates well with popular testing frameworks such as Mocha, Jasmine, and Cucumber.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

1. Simplified Syntax: WebDriverIO has a much cleaner syntax that makes test cases much easier to write.
1. Cross-browser compatibility: WebDriverIO supports running test cases across multiple browsers simultaneously, which can save a significant amount of time and effort for testers.
1. Easy to Integrate: WebDriverIO is easy to integrate with popular testing frameworks like Mocha, Jasmine, and Cucumber.
1. Supports Native and Hybrid Mobile Testing: WebDriverIO supports automated testing of mobile applications across multiple platforms, including Android and iOS.
1. Large Community: WebDriverIO has a vast online community, including a dedicated Slack channel, where users can get help on any issues they may encounter.

### What can we do with it

1. Creating automated tests for web applications using JavaScript.
1. Running tests on local machines or on cloud-based services like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack.
1. Interacting with web elements like buttons, forms, and text fields using various APIs.
1. Executing automated tests on different browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
1. Integrating with other tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions to automate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
1. Generating reports and screenshots to help analyze test results.

### How we adopted it

Can be using one of the framework to work on the automation testing, especially working quite well for Mobile Automation test.
