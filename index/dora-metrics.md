### Description

DORA Metrics, also known as DevOps Research and Assessment Metrics, are a set of metrics used to measure the performance of DevOps practices within an organization. These metrics are based on a research study conducted by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) group, which identified four key metrics that correlate with high-performing DevOps organizations:

1. Deployment Frequency: This measures how frequently an organization deploys code to production.
1. Lead Time for Changes: This measures the time it takes for code changes to go from code commit to production.
1. Time to Restore Service: This measures how quickly an organization can recover from a service disruption or outage.
1. Change Failure Rate: This measures the percentage of changes that result in degraded service or require remediation.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

DORA metrics provide a standard way for organizations to measure their DevOps performance and identify areas for improvement. By using DORA metrics, teams can get a better understanding of their software delivery process and identify bottlenecks and areas where they can improve efficiency.

### What can we do with it

With DORA metrics, engineering teams can track their progress over time and benchmark their performance against industry averages. This can help them identify areas where they are lagging behind and make data-driven decisions to improve their processes.

### How should we adopt it
