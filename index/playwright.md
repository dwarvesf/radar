### Description

Playwright is a powerful automation library that allows developers to write reliable and maintainable end-to-end tests for web applications. It provides a high-level API for interacting with web pages and automating browser actions, making it easier for developers to write and maintain complex test suites.

### What’s better about this method or library

One of the key benefits of Playwright is its ability to work with multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. This means that developers can write tests that are browser-agnostic, allowing them to test their applications across multiple platforms and browsers. Additionally, Playwright supports headless mode, which enables developers to run tests without a visible browser window, making it faster and more efficient to execute tests.

### What can we do with it

With Playwright, development teams can write comprehensive and reliable end-to-end tests for their web applications, ensuring that their applications function correctly across different browsers and platforms. The library provides a high-level API that simplifies the process of interacting with web pages, making it easier for developers to write and maintain tests. By automating the testing process, Playwright can also help reduce the time and effort required to manually test applications, allowing teams to focus on building new features and improving their applications.

### How should we adopt it

Playwright is one of powerful framework for Automation Testing and especially with the debug’s mode from it, making the test looks easier when having any issues. Can be treat as the consider framework when doing the E2E test.
