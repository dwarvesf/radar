## Software quality

We are living in an age where many things are impacted by technology, especially software. Building software is not about "What language should I learn/use?", "How to learn X in N steps". It's about automating things or make things perform in better actions or build something that means something; in other words, make our life more comfortable and more joyful to live.

And like other things in our life, we have a needs to push it to the utmost limit or at least meet the industry standard. But many of us have struggled to have a clear definition of software quality. Hence we found it's hard to able to build one.

The purpose of this study not only to have a definition of software quality, but it also provides the necessary mindset to possess and practices to apply. In general, it becomes a `framework` for engineers while building software.

The word `quality` might sound ambigous, becase the meaning of it also different for each perspective.

- Customer: quality in customer's view is our software meet their needs and achieve their satisfaction.
- Company: quality in company point of view can be defined as how much revenue the software brings to gì đó...
- Software engineer: quality means ... quality. a quality in SE's can be viewed as how well the software is designed and craftmenship here...

Since our main focus is actually .... so focus on SE .....

generally, software lifecycle can divide into 4 phase:

- Idea
- Design
- Construction
  - requirement
  - implement/coding
  - review
  - testing
- Maintenance/Integration

most of us, we tend to focus on the `implement/coding` phase, because it is easiest to see the progress, but it is a illusion bla bla. if we want to build a well-crafted software, it must happen in every phase in the process.

- Correctness
- Efficiency
- Flexibility
- Integrity
- Interoperability
- Maintainability
- Portability
- Reliability
- Reusability
- Testability
- Usability

in the perfect world, we can meet all of above attributes. But building is a game of tradeoff, depends on a needs of the software, we can set some attributes above others.

but let's say, we have a web application, it's still early, don't seek for too much performance, security, ...

below is a list of attributes which i think we should look into first when building a software
