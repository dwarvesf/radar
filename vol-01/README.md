# Dwarves Tech Radar - Vol 01

It is our first volume. We started working on it from January of 2020. The Dwarves have their tradition to explore the tech scene and learn new things. This occasion is the first time we sit down and do it in written form. It's a bit hard for the engineers at first, but we managed to complete the volume with ten reports.

Besides volume 01, we have an opportunity to sort out our current technology index and put it at https://d.foundation/radar. And for this edition, the theme is to get the whole team used to the concept of a central knowledge baseâ€”every study to expand our view to the tech scene counts. The design team also has a place to contribute and discuss their practices.
