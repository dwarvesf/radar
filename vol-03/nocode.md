## Webflow and bubble

We did bring up [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) in the previous version and applied it in [KiwiPay](https://kiwipay.webflow.io/) - marking our first attempt in no-code development. Succeeding this, we used Webflow to finetune the website of [ATVPro](https://atvpro.webflow.io/)

Aiming for a more complex tool, we dived in [bubble](https://bubble.io/) - a no-code tool with the same concept. After using it for one of our design projects, we realize it somehow refrains developers from learning and adjusting the code. Meanwhile, it requires a deeper level of code and database, making it hard for designers to pick up. 

That leaves us with hitting a pause on bubble, and sticking with Webflow for our future projects.
