## Description

Many organizations experience problems with software delivery because they have an unhelpful model of what software development is really about. An obsession with “feature delivery” ignores human-related and team-related dynamics inherent in modern software development, leading to disengagement from staff, especially when there are high cognitive loads.

The Team Topologies pattern enables teams to address all these points by establishing a team-first approach to software delivery based on four fundamental team types, three patterns of interaction between teams, and ways of turning difficulties in delivery into signals for the self-steering organization.

## Output Goal

- Re-structure organization to favor team-first thinking
- Setup enabling team to assist stream-align teams
- Create measurement metrics to evaluate collaboration effectiveness based on cognitive load, domain complexity, boundary size,…
