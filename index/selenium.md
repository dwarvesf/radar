### Description

Selenium framework is an automated testing tool used to perform functional testing on web applications. It is an open-source framework that allows testers to write scripts in various programming languages like Java, Python, C#, etc. Selenium offers a range of features that help testers design and execute tests with ease. Some of the key features include cross-browser testing, parallel testing, and support for multiple platforms. Additionally, Selenium offers integration with various tools like Jenkins and Git, enabling testers to leverage the benefits of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices. Overall, the Selenium framework is a reliable and robust choice for automating web application testing.
