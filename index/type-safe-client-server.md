### Description

Developers working on Javascript Applications often face the challenge of enforcing type safety between the client and server. One effective solution is to automatically generate an OpenAPI Spec file from server code. This can then be used with the OpenAPI generator to produce a client-side library for making typesafe API calls to the backend. Our existing workflow has adopted the typesafe approach using Swagger for API documentation. We aim to upgrade this approach by automating the generation of API methods.
