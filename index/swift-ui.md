## Description

Apple has taken a big step forward with their new SwiftUI framework for implementing user interfaces on the macOS and iOS platforms. We like that SwiftUI moves beyond the somewhat kludgy relationship between Interface Builder and Xcode and adopts a coherent, declarative and code-centric approach. You can now view your code and the resulting visual interface side by side in Xcode 11, making for a much better developer experience
