## Objective

- Define consistent practices and patterns for all API endpoints across the company
- Adhere as closely as possible to accepted REST/HTTP best practices in the industry at-large
- Allow for partners (developers, clients) to use these guidelines for their REST endpoint design


## Motivation

- Be more professional.
- The misunderstanding between team members if they have a bad API document and bad API definition.
- Help our team provide an API package standardized to the community.
- It is evident to show off our quality by exposing API documents to outside.
- Currently, our junior engineer always has some mistakes like naming convention, HTTP route name definition. And this document would help them.

## Benefit

- Easy to debug and investigate the problem that we go during development.
- There are more issues related to the communication between the backend team and the rest.
