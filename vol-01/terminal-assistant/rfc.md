## Objective
Terminal Assistant is CLI tool that should provide some knowledge about code or development process when you ask, should you suddenly forget and don't want to switch to browser and Google it.

## Motivation
I try to get my hand dirty to build up a tool alone, applying the techniques and process I have learned. The development of this tool provided me some valuable experiences about software processes, code optimization and heuristic approach.

Basically, the most significant problem of this work is the trade-offs between precision and performance. These trade-offs are the reason I am using heuristic approach to develop the assistant instead of using the more precise but performance-heavy methods.

## Benefit
This is just a tool tries to make some improvement for the development process. It is integrated with a rubber duck debugger for those who need it.
