### Description

UnoCSS is an atomic-CSS engine instead of a framework. Everything is designed with flexibility and performance in mind. There are no core utilities in UnoCSS, all functionalities are provided via presets.

### What’s better about this method or library

- On-demand CSS engine (similar to Tailwind JIT)
- Easy setup & usage: While fully customizable, UnoCSS ships with default presets that cover some popular utilities-first frameworks (Tailwind, Boostrap, etc.)
- Useful features:
- Attributify
- Pure CSS icons
- Variant grouping
- …
- Improved performance through multiple optimization:
- No Parsing, No Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Single pass - No pre-scanning or file io

### What can we do with it

Pretty much what TailwindCSS can do, but a bit faster.

### How should we adopt it

By practice. We are already using TailwindCSS, so switching to UnoCSS is just a matter of configuration. Very low learning curve.
