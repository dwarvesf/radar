## Objective

The goal here is to have a basic SwiftUI guide. At least enough for making a simple SwiftUI app.

This guide will include some basic stuff for working with SwiftUI, such as how to layout views, handle user input, making a custom view, making a cross Apple platform apps, basic architecture, integrate with UIKit (the old Apple UI framework), my opinions about SwiftUI.

This guide will not include the advance stuff like making fancy animation or propose the best architecture we should follow when working with SwiftUI

## Motivation

- SwiftUI is a new UI framework and still lacking of good documents. I hope my job will be helpful for new developer who is interested in SwiftUI.
- Some good SwiftUI guide
    - [Apple official tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/)
    - [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/)

## Benefit

- Have a guide for a new iOS developer or the one who just started learning SwiftUI to follow
- Have a note for me when I need to retro something related to SwiftUI
