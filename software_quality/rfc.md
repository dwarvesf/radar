## Motivation & Benefit


We are living in an age where many things are impacted by technology, especially software. Building software is not about "What language should I learn/use?", "How to learn X in N steps". It's about automating things or make things perform in better actions or build something that means something; in other words, make our life more comfortable and more joyful to live.

And like other things in our life, we have a needs to push it to its limit or at least meet the industry standard. But many of us have struggled to have a clear definition of software quality. Hence we found it's hard to able to build one.

The purpose of this study not only to have a definition of software quality, but it also provides the necessary mindset to possess and practices to apply. In general, it becomes a `framewok` for engineers while building software.
