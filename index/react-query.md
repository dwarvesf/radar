### Description

React Query is a powerful library for managing and caching data in React applications. It provides a way to fetch, cache, and update data without the need for complex state management code. React Query also includes features like caching, refetching, pagination, and more. It makes it easy to work with complex data structures and to handle data dependencies between components. With React Query, you can easily manage data in your React applications in a performant and scalable way.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

React Query provides several benefits over traditional methods or libraries for managing data in React applications. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. **Improved performance:** React Query uses a cache to store data and reduces the number of network requests by automatically refetching data when needed. This results in faster page load times and a smoother user experience.
1. **Simplified code**: With React Query, you can write less boilerplate code for data fetching and state management. This simplifies your codebase and reduces the chances of bugs.
1. **Data synchronization**: React Query automatically updates your UI when data changes, reducing the need for manual updates and making it easier to keep your UI in sync with your data.
1. **Flexibility**: React Query is highly configurable and can be used with various backends, including REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and more. It also supports pagination, optimistic updates, and other advanced features.

### What can we do with it

Here are some examples of what we can do with it:

1. **Data fetching**: React Query simplifies data fetching by providing a clean API for fetching data from various sources, including REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and more.
1. **Caching**: React Query includes a cache that allows you to store and retrieve data without needing to refetch it from the server. This can significantly improve the performance of your application.
1. **Data synchronization**: React Query automatically updates your UI when data changes, reducing the need for manual updates and making it easier to keep your UI in sync with your data.
1. **Pagination**: React Query includes built-in support for pagination, allowing you to easily fetch and display large sets of data.
1. **Optimistic updates**: React Query supports optimistic updates, which allow you to update the UI immediately with the expected result of an update, even before the server has responded.

### How should we adopt it
