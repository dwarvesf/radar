### Description

A software architectural style where a frontend application is decomposed into small, independent, and autonomous components that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each micro-frontend is responsible for a specific part of the user interface, and it can be developed by a separate team using a different technology stack.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

- Improves productivity:
- Teams can work independently on different parts of the application, allowing for faster development cycles
- Easier maintenance and evolution of the application, as updates to one micro-frontend do not affect the others
- Faster time to market
- Greater flexibility and scalability:
- Each micro-frontend can be developed using the technology that is best suited for the specific functionality it provides
- Allows for a more modular and adaptable architecture, as new micro-frontends can be added or removed as needed to meet changing business requirements
- Each micro-frontend can be deployed independently, enabling continuous delivery and reducing the risk of downtime or errors
- Reduced risk of system failures:
- If one micro-frontend fails, the rest of the application can continue to function. This reduces the risk of system failures and downtime for end-users.

### What can we do with it

We can apply it to:

- Large-scale enterprise applications
- E-commerce platforms
- Banking and financial applications
- Content management systems
- Any type of custom software application that requires high scalability, flexibility, and maintainability

### How should we adopt it

- Research blog posts for a better understanding of the concepts and principles behind the architecture, and also help to educate others in the team
- Case studies into existing projects that already applied this (e.g. Setel, Mudah)
- Set-up a small proof of concept with popular stack for Micro FE (e.g. Webpack Module Federation)
