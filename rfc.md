## Objective

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and
non-goals? This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

## Motivation

Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed
to show how this design addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports
this? What related work exists?

## Benefit

How will people benefit from this work? How this can benefit your work?

## Code & Documents/Slides

Link to your code folder (for tool) or documents/slides (for Technique, Langues, Framework and Platform)

## Tutorials and Examples

- We should create end-to-end examples (ideally, a tutorial) which reflects how this tech will be used. Some things to consider related to the tutorial:
  - The minimum requirements for this are to consider how this would be used
    (prerequisites knowledge, preinstalled applications, ...).
  - This should be written as if it is documentation of the new user, not for experienced developers.
  
### All the code and document/slide + tutorial/example should be uploaded in the same directory with the RFC file
