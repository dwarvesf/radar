### Description

WebAssembly (WASM) is a low-level binary format that serves as a virtual machine for executing code on the web. It is a portable, secure, and efficient format that can be used to run code in web browsers and other environments.

WebAssembly was designed to address some of the limitations of traditional web technologies, such as JavaScript. Unlike JavaScript, which is an interpreted language, WebAssembly code is compiled to a binary format that can be executed directly by the browser or other environments, providing faster performance.

WebAssembly code can be written in a variety of programming languages, including C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript. Once compiled, it can be run in the browser alongside JavaScript, allowing developers to build more complex and performant web applications.

### Whatâ€™s better about this method or library

WebAssembly has a number of benefits over traditional web technologies, including:

1. **Performance**: WebAssembly code can be compiled to native machine code, which provides faster performance than interpreted JavaScript.
1. **Security**: WebAssembly runs in a sandboxed environment, which provides additional security against malicious code.
1. **Portability**: WebAssembly code can be run on any platform that supports the WebAssembly virtual machine, including web browsers, servers, and embedded devices.
1. **Language** flexibility: WebAssembly allows developers to write code in a variety of languages, which can be compiled to run on the web.

However, there are some considerations to keep in mind when using WebAssembly:

1. **Development complexity**: Writing code in languages other than JavaScript and compiling it to WebAssembly can be more complex than using JavaScript, so it may require more development resources and expertise.
1. **Browser support**: While most modern web browsers support WebAssembly, some older browsers do not, so you may need to include fallbacks or alternative solutions.
1. **Interoperability**: While WebAssembly can be used alongside JavaScript, there may be some limitations to interoperability between the two, especially when it comes to complex data structures and APIs.

### What can we do with it

WebAssembly (WASM) can be used for a wide range of applications, including:

1. **High-performance web applications**: WebAssembly can provide faster performance than interpreted JavaScript, making it a good choice for applications that require high performance, such as games, simulations, and media processing.
1. **Porting existing code**: WebAssembly allows developers to write code in languages other than JavaScript, such as C++, Rust, or Go, and compile that code to run on the web. This can be useful for porting existing applications or libraries to the web.
1. **Server-side applications**: WebAssembly can be used to run code on the server, providing a more efficient and portable solution than traditional server-side technologies.
1. **Online collaboration tools**: WebAssembly can provide a secure and sandboxed environment for running untrusted code, making it a good choice for online collaboration tools or code editors.
1. **Internet of Things (IoT) devices**: WebAssembly can run on a wide range of devices, including embedded devices, making it a good choice for IoT applications.

Overall, WebAssembly is a versatile technology that can be used for a wide range of applications. While it is still in the early stages of adoption, it has already been used in a number of applications, including games, simulations, media processing, and server-side applications.
